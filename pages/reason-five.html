                Your style is definitely something I love about you. 
                You look so perfect with every single outfit you wear! Every day I see you, you
                look more and more beautiful. You can rock anything you wear, so wear them with confidence! 
                I keep saying this but you could definitely be a model, though if you do, you wouldn't have 
                any competition because no one can come close your fashion choice and beauty in my eyes.
