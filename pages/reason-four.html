                You have incredible talent!!! Like it's so amazing to me how good you are
                at cooking, at drawing, and with music. I swear you can sing to basically any song that starts to play. 
                I love that so much! Not only that but that way you play the guitar, and your VOICE!! my gosh!
                You have a voice of an angel! I can't help but stop what I do when you sing. SO beautiful!

                to look at the details you add to your masterpieces! Your vision is honestly beautiful for me

                I think watching all those episodes of Hell's Kitchen was an inspiration. Haha I'm kidding
