                I love how you think. It is so beautiful to listen to you speak about things that you do or are interested in. 
                It is amazing hearing your persepective on the way you see life and the things around you. Not only that
                but I love your humor and the jokes you come up with. They might not me as good as mine, but you are slowly getting there ;) hahaha
