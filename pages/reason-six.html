                there are times where is gets difficult, but know that I will always be there. you are no alone.
                You are so strong and I know you are capable of many more great things. You are so amazing I know that soon 
                You will be blessed with the most amazing life, because you deserve it. You deserve the very best
                because you are there for everyone that you care about. Even though they have hurt you, you put that aside

                are literally an angel from heaven that makes everyone's life so much. I know many don't deserve what you offer, but that 
                just shows just how amazing and perfect you are. I don't know how I got so lucky. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart
                Nicole I love you. So much. My love for you is eternal. I swear I couldn't love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow.
